    <p>I am a North Carolina native and graduated from East Carolina University with a Bachelor of Science in Political
        Science. I currently live in the triangle area and have been in the financial services industry since 2012. I am
        currently in a supervisory role at Fidelity Investments managing over fifteen associates. I have portrayed
        strong leadership abilities, strong customer service orientation, resolve issues thoroughly and most importantly
        the ability to adjust to stress and deadlines.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I enrolled into the UNCâ€™s Coding Bootcamp to transition my career into a more technical role and boost my career growth. I have always enjoyed learning new subjects, being apart of a team, and I'm excited to see where this opportunity will take me. </p>
    <br>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and reading books.</p>
